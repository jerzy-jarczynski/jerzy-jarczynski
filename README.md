# Hello World!

I started with **C++** (Alex Allain, Jumping into C++) in **2015**, at which time I was studying architecture at Poznan University of Technology. During my apprenticeship, I decided that I wanted to work with computers as a computer scientist.

In 2017, I changed my major to **Computer Science** at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan. This is also when I started working at **IT Support**. In my free time at work, I learned web technologies. It was going strenuously. At university I was exposed to **C/C++**, **Java**, **Python**, **Golang**, **SQL**, as well as **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS**. There was also a lot of maths, the best of which were logic and integrals. I hardly remember anything today. I completed 2 years of studies.

I got a job as a developer in 2020. I built **responsive** web fronts based on templates in **Zeplin**. I got fired after six months because I blew a deadline. Maybe that was a good thing.
I learned how to work with a **CMS** (this one happened to be based on **Laravel**), **Bootstrap** and **jQuery** libraries.

In 2021 I worked in Customer Service at a **hosting** company - another exposure to IT. I worked on **Linux Mint**, installed **Wordpress** on shared servers, looked into PHPMyAdmin, chatted with admins. It was fun.

At the end of 2022, I finally went to **Bootcamp**. It lasted for 10 months from the beginning of 2023. I consolidated what I knew so far with **HTML**, **CSS**, **RWD**, **JS**. I finally grasped my first framework - **React**. Then it was time for the **backend**. JS was at the forefront all the time, so I learned **Node**, **Express**, **Nest.js**.

The bootcamp resulted in a current github account and most repositories. I'm currently working on sorting out what's already closed, what I'm currently working on and what I plan to work on in the near future.

My future directions are mobile technologies (**Dart/Flutter**), learning **PHP/Laravel** and building a **CMS** for my own use, learning to build sites based on **WordPress** (I need money) and becoming better at **React** and **JS ES6**.
